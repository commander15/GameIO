GameIO is a lightweight, cross-platform C++/Qt library built on top of **Qt 6** and **SDL 2**, designed to simplify gamepad input handling in Qt applications. It provides both a modern declarative QML interface and a robust C++ backend to support real-time access to buttons, axes, and device metadata.
